### üì± Headline Summary (Tweet-length)  
Bias, consent & explainability: ethicists warn that without guardrails, AI could widen health gaps. New ‚ÄúAlgorithmic Bill of Rights‚Äù gains steam. #AIethics #Healthcare  

### üìã Executive Summary  
Healthcare Ethics examines moral dilemmas posed by AI adoption. Core concerns include dataset bias (Black patients 5 times more likely to receive inaccurate pulse-oximeter readings), opaque decision-making, and the erosion of informed consent when algorithms continuously evolve. The piece reviews policy proposals: the U.S. ‚ÄúAlgorithmic Bill of Rights,‚Äù EU AI Act, and WHO‚Äôs six guiding principles. Case studies show harm, such as a Dutch risk-scoring tool that wrongly flagged immigrant families for fraud. Experts advocate transparency audits, bias-testing sandboxes, and participatory design involving patients. Hospitals are urged to establish ethics boards parallel to IRBs. The article concludes that ethical governance is not optional but foundational to sustainable AI-driven care.  

### üìñ Comprehensive Summary  
The feature frames AI ethics as a public-health issue, not merely a technical one.  

Sources of Bias  
   ‚Ä¢ Historical data encode systemic inequities (e.g., insurance claims as proxies for illness severity).  
   ‚Ä¢ Devices like pulse oximeters under-perform on darker skin; AI models trained on their readings inherit the error.  

Consent & Autonomy  
   ‚Ä¢ Continuous-learning systems drift from their validated state, challenging traditional informed-consent models.  
   ‚Ä¢ Stanford‚Äôs pilot e-consent platform lets patients set data-use preferences, but only 34 % fully understand algorithmic risks.  

Explainability  
   ‚Ä¢ Black-box outputs limit accountability. The article profiles DARPA‚Äôs XAI program producing saliency maps that raise clinician trust scores from 58 % to 82 %.  

Legal & Regulatory Movements  
   ‚Ä¢ The proposed U.S. ‚ÄúAlgorithmic Bill of Rights‚Äù would grant individuals the right to opt out of automated decisions.  
   ‚Ä¢ The EU AI Act may classify high-risk medical AI as requiring CE-mark conformity assessments and post-market surveillance.  

Ethics-in-Practice  
   ‚Ä¢ Kaiser Permanente formed an Algorithmic Oversight Committee with veto power over deployments.  
   ‚Ä¢ The UK‚Äôs NHS X mandates model-card disclosure detailing data provenance and demographic performance.
